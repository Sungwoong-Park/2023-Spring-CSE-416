### `SUKOCO`
Many new students have a problem finding information about their colleges including SUNY Korea. After being a SUNY Korea student for two years, I felt the absence of the school community among SUNY Korea students, because of this, I was not able to know which courses by which professors are better. This inconvenience disturbed me to choose classes to take.

Sukoco is a web application designed to help communication between SUNY Korea students, and manage their timetable.
- Ability to create timetable and add courses by their course number.
- Ability to view and create the review of professors.

This product is to support students to make decisions for which courses they should take. Product will not suggest any information or opinions to users directly. Our product is to give only the public opinion.
